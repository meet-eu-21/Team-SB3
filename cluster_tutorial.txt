TUTORIAL on how to launch our pipeline for interchromosomal and intrachromosomal compartments detection.

You can get most of the info needed in https://ifb-elixirfr.gitlab.io/cluster/doc/
----------------------------------

PART ONE : How to connect to the clusterr 

---

If you are on Windows, please install PuTTy to connect with SSH to the cluster. Configure it 
with port 22. (more on https://ifb-elixirfr.gitlab.io/cluster/doc/logging-in/).

On Linux or Mac, launch a command screen. Then type the following code :

ssh <username>@core.cluster.france-bioinformatique.fr

replace <username> by you actual user name.

Then type your password. If you are granted an account, you are in. Else, see with Elodie Laine
if she can provide you one.

-------------------------------------------

PART TWO : How to navigate in the cluster

---

By default, you are on the path /shared/home, on your own folder.

Clone the git repository :

git clone https://github.com/meet-eu-21/Team-SB3/

Type in your username and password. All the repo files should download. 

Now access Code folder by typing :

cd Team-SB3/Code/

-----------------------------------------

PART THREE : Launch our code and get the results on your local device.

If you want to get intrachromosomal compartments, just type sbatch pipeline_intra.sh
If you want to get interchromosomal compartments, juste type sbatch pipeline_inter.sh

You job is now in the queue. To see its status, just type squeue -u username.



 
To make it accessible for everyone of the team members, file are saved in the /shared/projects/form_2021_21/SB3/ path.

To go there, just type :


cd /shared/projects/form_2021_21/SB3/


To get the files, I highly recommend you to download Filezilla. On Linux and Mac, it is pretty simple, juste type sudo apt-get install filezilla. Other options are available here: https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/filezilla

On Windows, download FileZilla software adapted to your Windows version. 

Then launch the software, and connect via SSH with the same login and password as for command line connecting. 

You are now in the cluster, but a more handy graphical interface is helping you !!!!

Now select the file you want and drag and drop it to your local machine


If you do not want to download FileZilla, it is made possible to download files with command line. Choices are given in https://ifb-elixirfr.gitlab.io/cluster/doc/quick-start/ in the Transfer chapter.
